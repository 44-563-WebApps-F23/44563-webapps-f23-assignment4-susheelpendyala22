<p>KNUT BROVIK :</p>
<p>[Rises suddenly, as if in distress, from the table; breathes heavily and
laboriously as he comes forward into the doorway.] No, I can't bear it
much longer!</p>

<p>KAIA :</p>

<p>[Going up to him.] You are feeling very ill this evening, are you not,
    Uncle?</p>


<p>BROVIK :</p>

<p>Oh, I seem to get worse every day.</p>


<p>RAGNAR :</p>

<p>[Has risen and advances.] You ought to go home, father. Try to get a
    little sleep--</p>


<p>BROVIK :</p>

<p>[Impatiently.] Go to bed, I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?</p>


<p>KAIA :</p>

<p>Then take a little walk.</p>


<p>RAGNAR :</p>

<p>Yes, do. I will come with you.</p>
